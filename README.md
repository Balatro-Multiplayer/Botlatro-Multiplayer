## Quick Setup Steps
- Clone the repo
- npm install (though the repo currently has all of the node modules in it, going to fix that to take them out today)
- Download postgresql and set it all up on your PC properly
- Add the .env file to your project (Narwhal will send you the details or I can)
- `npx node-pg-migrate up` to initialize the DB
- `npm start` to run the bot
